# Add to Cart Application

## Overview

The Add to Cart application is a web-based project that allows users to efficiently manage and organize their tasks or items by adding them to a cutting-edge list. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while Firebase serves as the database for real-time data storage. Additionally, Node.js is employed as the server to handle requests and avoid CORS errors during development.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** Intuitive and visually appealing design for seamless user interaction.
- **Real-time Updates:** Utilizes Firebase to provide instant updates and synchronization across multiple devices.
- **Node.js Server:** Implements a Node.js server to handle backend operations and mitigate CORS issues during development.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Markup language for creating the structure of web pages.
- **CSS:** Stylesheet language for enhancing the visual presentation of the application.
- **JavaScript:** Programming language for adding dynamic behavior to the frontend.
- **Firebase:** Cloud-based database for real-time data storage and synchronization.
- **Node.js:** Server-side JavaScript runtime for handling backend operations.
